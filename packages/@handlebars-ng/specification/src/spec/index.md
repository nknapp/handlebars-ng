# Handlebars Language Specification

The [Introduction](./01-introduction/) may be a good starting point.

# Early work in progress

**Please note that this project is in a very early work in progress stage.**

The specification just contains very few features of the original Handlebars program. It will grow along with the parser- and runner implementation.
