# Handlebars Language Specification

The [Introduction](./01-introduction/) may be a good starting point.

# Early work in progress

**Please note that this project is in a very early work in progress stage.**

The specification just contains very few features of the original Handlebars program. It will grow along with the parser- and runner implementation.

# Grammar notation

In order to specify the syntax of Handlebars, we use the grammar defined in [the emcma262 specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-notational-conventions). For compiling and validating the grammar, we use the same tool as ecma2: [grammarkdown](https://github.com/rbuckton/grammarkdown)
