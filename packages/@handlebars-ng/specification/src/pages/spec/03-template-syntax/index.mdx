# Template Syntax

A template (Program) consists of zero or more Statements

```
Program = { Statement }

Statement =
    MustacheStatement |
    ContentStatement
```

**TODO: Add more statement types here**

## Content-Statement

Everything that is not any other Statment is considered to be Content.
Content is copied "as is" to the output.

[](./content.hb-spec.json)

An exception are escaped mustache statements.
If a mustache token ("`{{`" or "`{{{`") is prefixed with `\`, the backslash is removed from the output, but the `{{` remains.

[](./escaped-content.hb-spec.json)

## Mustache-Statment

```handlebars
{{path.expression}}
```

In the output, it will be replaced by the result of the path expression, escaping output as HTML by default.

A path expression can have following the following forms:

- An single identifier
- A list of identifiers
