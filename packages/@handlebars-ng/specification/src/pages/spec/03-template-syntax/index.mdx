# Template Syntax

A template (Program) consists of zero or more Statements

```ebnf
Program = { Statement }

Statement =
    MustacheStatement |
    ContentStatement
```

**TODO: Add more statement types here**

## Content-Statement

Everything that is not any other Statment is considered to be Content.
Content is copied "as is" to the output.

[](./contents.hb-spec.json)

**TODO Mustache escaping via "\"**

[](./escaped-mustaches.hb-spec.json)

```handlebars
{{path.expression}}
```

In the output, it will be replaced by the result of the path expression.

A path expression can have following the following forms:
