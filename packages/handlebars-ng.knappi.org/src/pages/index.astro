  <Card
    header="Clear language definition"
    action={{ label: "To the specification", href: "/spec/" }}
  >
    A concise language definition, with language-independent test cases, so you can implement your own compatible parser and runtime.
  </Card>
  <Card header="Compatibilty">
    Parser and runtime are tested against the spec, which is derived from Handlebars 4.x. The new Handlebars should be compatible
    for most use-cases.
  </Card>
  <Card header="Performance">
    We use a custom parser and a visitor-based runtime, which should be faster than Handlebars 4.x. Automated performance-tests
    will be made (TODO) and visualized.
