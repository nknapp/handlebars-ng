# Benchmarks

These benchmarks are generated as part of the CI pipeline.
We compare the original Handlebars parser with the next-generation parser,
and the Handlebars compiler (template execution) with the next-generation runner

_The benchmarks look very good, but please be aware that we have only implemented very basic features so far.
I expect Handlebars NG to become slower when more features are implemented._

# Parser

<BenchmarkResult client:only name="parser" />

# Runner

<BenchmarkResult client:only name="runner" />

# Contributing tests

Although this project is still in a very early stage, it would be nice to have some real-life templates
to run the benchmarks. If you want to contribute tests, feel free to create an MR. Just add a subfolder to [this folder](https://github.com/nknapp/handlebars-ng/tree/main/packages/%40handlebars-ng/benchmarks/src/tests) and add files there.

The template of the test must be released under an Open Source license, so do not use templates from your private projects.
Otherwise, have a look at [generate-benchmarks.ts](https://github.com/nknapp/handlebars-ng/tree/main/packages/handlebars-ng.knappi.org/scripts/generate-benchmarks.ts)

You can use the same tools to run benchmarks yourself (when the project has advanced a little and was published to npm...)
