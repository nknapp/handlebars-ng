# Benchmarks

The following benchmarks show the performance of the original Handlebars.js implementation
and the implementation in this repo.

These benchmarks are generated as part of the CI pipeline.

## Disclaimer

The benchmarks look like the Handlebars NG is much faster, but keep in mind that we have only implemented very basic features so far.
I expect it to become slower when more features are implemented.

Please also be aware that micro-benchmarks like this may not be expressive. I am not sure how valuable the results really are since the
standard-deviation is very high in some tests.

## How to read the data

- The numbers in the table are `xÌ„="mean" p99="99th percentile value"` of the runtime of each task
- The charts show the range "`[ mean, p99 ]`".

## Parser

<BenchmarkResult client:only name="parser" />

## Runner

<BenchmarkResult client:only name="runner" />

## Contributing tests

Although this project is still in a very early stage, it would be nice to have some real-life templates
to run the benchmarks. If you want to contribute tests, feel free to create an MR. Just add a subfolder to [this folder](https://github.com/nknapp/handlebars-ng/tree/main/packages/%40handlebars-ng/benchmarks/src/tests) and add files there.

The template of the test must be released under an Open Source license, so do not use templates from your private projects.
Otherwise, have a look at [generate-benchmarks.ts](https://github.com/nknapp/handlebars-ng/tree/main/packages/handlebars-ng.knappi.org/scripts/generate-benchmarks.ts)

You can use the same tools to run benchmarks yourself (when the project has advanced a little and was published to npm...)
